Pyecog as a python module
==================================

Currently the smoothest way to use pyecog is to to use jupyter notebooks for file conversion, feature extraction and training/applying classifiers.

While these can be done with the GUI, it is a little clunky, and any uncaught error with crash the window :(

Furthermore, interacting with the files through python directly does not restrict your analysis to pre-coded routines.
